            <title><![CDATA[Self-Hosting Analytics with Plausible]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>I was recently looking for a cheap way to move a few sites off of Google Analytics
and began looking into various options, both cloud-hosted and self-hosted.</p><h2>Available Options</h2><p>Unfortunately most cloud-hosted options (that aren't google analytics)
are relatively pricy for what are essentially low traffic sites. After a bit of evalution
the best options seemed to be:</p><ul><li><a href="https://usefathom.com/pricing">Fathom (cloud)</a> - $14/month</li><li><a href="https://github.com/usefathom/fathom">Fathom (self-hosted)</a> - ~$5/month</li><li><a href="https://matomo.org/pricing/">Matamo (cloud)</a> - $30/month</li><li><a href="https://github.com/matomo-org/matomo">Matamo (self-hosted)</a> - $10/month (greater server requirements)</li><li><a href="https://plausible.io/">Plausible (cloud)</a> - $6/month</li><li><a href="https://github.com/plausible/analytics">Plausible (self-hosted)</a> - $5/month</li></ul>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[Speeding Up PHP in Docker w/ XDebug]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>I've been using Docker for my local environments at Vanilla since 2017.
It was a good way to ensure consistent &amp; reproducible developer environments
and was a marked improvement over what we were running before. We setup a single repository
with our shared environment (<a href="https://github.com/vanilla/vanilla-docker">vanilla-docker</a>) and
it spread across the company like wildfire.</p><p>The consistency was great, especially as we onboarded various junior developers over the years.
Unfortunately in 2018, Apple released MacOS High Sierra, sporting a new filesystem, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_File_System">APFS</a>.</p>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[Hello world]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>I've been meening to start my own blog post for some time. I've written a few posts on <a href="https://dev.to">dev.to</a> before
but I decided that if I was going to keep doing it, I would it would be best to have it on my own domain.</p><p>I'm aiming to write frequently, at least once a week until this Covid-19 pandemic is over.</p><p>This is mostly intended as a bit of a future journal for myself, but hopefully anyone else reading it can get some
utility out of my programming experiences.</p>]]></description>
