I've been meening to start my own blog post for some time. I've written a few posts on [dev.to](https://dev.to) before
but I decided that if I was going to keep doing it, I would it would be best to have it on my own domain.

I'm aiming to write frequently, at least once a week until this Covid-19 pandemic is over.

This is mostly intended as a bit of a future journal for myself, but hopefully anyone else reading it can get some
utility out of my programming experiences.
