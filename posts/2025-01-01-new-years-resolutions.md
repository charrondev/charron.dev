It's been a long time since I actually sat down and did some development blogging. In the past few years I've gotten married, bought a house, changed countries and grown a lot as a developer.

When I look back though all I have here is a bunch of half-written posts. I've made a resolution to write more and to keep to that, I will be writing nice short posts to capture interesting projects that I have a chance to work with.
