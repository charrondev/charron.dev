# Writing Style Guide for Blog Posts

This guide defines the writing style for blog posts on charron.dev. Follow these patterns to maintain consistency across all articles.

## Frontmatter

Every post must start with frontmatter in YAML format:

```yaml
---
name: "Article Title"
slug: article-slug
excerpt: A brief description of what the article covers. Keep it conversational and personal.
tags:
    - Tag1
    - Tag2
---
```

## Tone and Voice

### Use First-Person, Personal Voice
- ✅ "I've been working with..."
- ✅ "I decided to benchmark..."
- ✅ "I wanted to understand..."
- ✅ "I found that..."
- ❌ "This article explores..."
- ❌ "We created a benchmark..."
- ❌ "Our research demonstrates..."

### Be Conversational, Not Academic
- ✅ Write like you're explaining to a colleague
- ✅ Use contractions (it's, don't, can't)
- ✅ Keep sentences relatively short
- ❌ Avoid formal academic language
- ❌ Don't use phrases like "This article explores", "Our findings indicate", "It is worth noting that"

## Structure

### Avoid Overly Formal Sections
- ❌ "Introduction" as a heading
- ❌ "Conclusion" as a heading (use "Takeaways" instead)
- ❌ "Key Findings" or "Key Observations" as separate sections
- ✅ Integrate findings naturally into the narrative
- ✅ Use descriptive section headings that explain what's coming

### Opening
Start with a personal hook or context:
- ✅ "I've been working with X for years..."
- ✅ "Recently, I decided to..."
- ✅ "I was recently looking for..."
- ❌ Formal introductions that explain what the article will cover

### Paragraph Length
- Keep paragraphs relatively short (2-4 sentences typically)
- Break up dense technical explanations
- Use line breaks to improve readability

## Language Patterns

### Personal Context
Always include personal context:
- Why you investigated this
- What you discovered
- Real-world scenarios you've encountered

### Avoid Repetition
- Don't repeat the same information multiple times
- If you show a table or data, don't repeat it in multiple sections
- Trust the reader to remember earlier information

### Soften Formal Language
- ❌ "This represents a best-case scenario"
- ✅ "I designed this to represent a best-case scenario"
- ❌ "The benchmark demonstrates"
- ✅ "The benchmark shows" or "I found that"

## Examples

### Good Opening
```
I've been using Docker for my local environments at Vanilla since 2017.
It was a good way to ensure consistent & reproducible developer environments
and was a marked improvement over what we were running before.
```

### Good Personal Context
```
I wanted to quantify the impact of this, so I created a benchmark comparing
PSR-15 recursive middleware against a stackless flat iteration approach.
```

### Good Section Transition
```
You might be wondering: when would you actually hit 100+ middleware layers?
I tested up to 100 layers to reflect patterns I've seen in large, mature
PHP codebases.
```

### Avoid This
```
## Introduction

When building web applications in PHP, middleware is a fundamental pattern
for handling cross-cutting concerns. This article explores the performance
impact of stack depth and demonstrates how a flat iteration approach can
dramatically improve performance.

## Key Findings

1. Exponential Performance Degradation: PSR-15 recursive middleware shows...
2. Scaling Characteristics: The performance gap widens dramatically...
```

## Technical Content

### Code Examples
- Include code examples when relevant
- Explain what the code does, but keep explanations concise
- Reference GitHub repos or external resources when appropriate

### Data and Benchmarks
- Present data clearly (tables are fine)
- Don't repeat the same data in multiple places
- Explain what the data means in plain language
- Include context about why the benchmarks might be conservative or optimistic

### Real-World Examples
- Reference actual projects or companies when relevant (e.g., Vanilla Forums)
- Explain real-world scenarios where the problem occurs
- Use examples from your own experience

## Closing

### Use "Takeaways" Instead of "Conclusion"
- Summarize key points
- Keep it conversational
- End with practical advice or next steps when appropriate

### Example Closing
```
## Takeaways

Stack depth has a profound impact on PHP performance. The benchmarks show
that recursive middleware introduces exponential performance degradation as
stack depth increases, while flat iteration maintains near-linear performance.

For applications with deep middleware stacks, adopting a flat iteration
approach can provide 30-60% performance improvements...
